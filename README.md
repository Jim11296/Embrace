# Embrace

[Embrace](https://www.ricciadams.com/projects/embrace) is a music player designed for the unique
challenges of DJing social dance events. It focuses on playing back a single set list without
audio glitches or accidental interruptions.

## Philosophy

Audio programming is hard. macOS audio programming is harder
(usually due to sparse documentation). This repository is publicly-viewable
in the hopes that its source code can help others.

Embrace is feature-complete and closed to outside contributions.
**Please do not submit pull requests**.

If you are struggling with an audio or DSP concept, you can
contact me via my [contact form](https://www.ricciadams.com) and
I can try to point you in the right direction.
